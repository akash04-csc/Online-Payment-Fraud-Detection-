##  Fraud Detection: Exploratory Data Analysis & Machine Learning

This project involves data exploration and machine learning modeling for fraud detection using a tabular dataset. The objective is to analyze the data, identify patterns and relationships, and build a model to predict fraudulent transactions.

### Files

* `code.ipynb` â€” Jupyter Notebook containing the entire workflow:

  * Data loading
  * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  * Preprocessing
  * Model training and evaluation

* `Fraud Detection Dataset.csv` â€” The dataset used for analysis (expected to be in the same directory).
* 
NOTE:The pickle file storing the model is too large to be pushed to the repository

###  Features

* **EDA** using pandas, matplotlib, seaborn to understand data distributions, correlations, and class imbalance.
* **Data preprocessing** including handling categorical variables and missing values.
* **Model training** using machine learning classifiers such as:

  * Random Forest
  * Logistic Regression
  * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  * KNN
* **Model evaluation** using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
* **SMOTE** used for balancing imbalanced datasets.

###  Results

The notebook evaluates the performance of multiple models and compares them based on metrics like accuracy and F1-score. Class imbalance is addressed using SMOTE to improve prediction performance on minority classes.
